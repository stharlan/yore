A win32 server that uses IO completion ports. Just another project for fun and to learn.

Uses IO Completion ports for all I/O.

Uses [Boost Logging](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/log/doc/html/index.html).

Includes a dotnet 6 testing program that uses XUnit's assert for testing against HTTP/1.1.

Does *NOT* fully implement HTTP/1.1. Maybe never will, but, we'll see how far I get...
